// A promise in JavaScript is exactly what it sounds like - you use it to make a promise to do something, 
// usually asynchronously. When the task completes, you ou cumprir your promise or fail to do so. Promise 
// is a constructor function, so you need to use the new keyword to create one. It takes a function, as 
// its argument, with two parameters - resolve and reject. These are methods used to determine the outcome 
// of the promise. The syntax looks like this:


// const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject)=> {
  
// }); 
                         // EXAMPLE //
// const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
//     let responseFromServer;
      
//     if(responseFromServer) {
//       resolve("We got the data");
//     } else {  
//       reject("Data not received");
//     }
//   });

//   Promises are most useful when you have a process that takes an unknown amount of time in your code 
//   (i.e. something asynchronous), often a server request. When you make a server request it takes some 
//   amount of time, and after it completes you usually want to do something with the response from the 
//   server. This can be achieved by using the then method. The then method is executed immediately after 
//   your promise is fulfilled with resolve. Hereâ€™s an example:

const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // responseFromServer is set to true to represent a successful response from a server
    let responseFromServer = true;
      
    if(responseFromServer) {
      resolve("We got the data");
    } else {  
      reject("Data not received");
    }
  });
    makeServerRequest.then(result => {
    console.log(result);
  });

    makeServerRequest.catch(error => {
        console.log(error); 
  });
